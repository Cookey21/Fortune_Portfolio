This analyzes the records from a call center. The data set was exported from an excel workbook. A few data cleaning was done with the use of power query, this cleaning included replacing values, renaming columns and filtering rows. It was then loaded into powerbi for visualization. The datasetfor this project was lost which is why it was not uploaded.

This analyses was done to show the gender disparities when giving nobel prizes within the year 1901 to 2019. The dataset was downloaded from kaggle and was uploaded in the project 2 file. Some research questions were drafted out to guide our analyses before data cleaning process was done with the use of power query and visualization to display a clear view of the differences amongst gender when giving nobel prize awards. The project was done with my team during Tech4Dev data analysis bootcamp.
